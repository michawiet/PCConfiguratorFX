            <p>Modern CPUs are quite powerful, and the cheapest of our recommendations would be enough for someone simply browsing the web, using Office, and watching YouTube or Netflix. Games and serious work applications will see significant benefit from more powerful CPUs, and may not run at all on a weak CPU.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The two major CPU manufacturers are AMD and Intel. Deciding between these two brands generally depends on what price bracket you are looking at. It is better to evaluate the available products to see what fits your needs, instead of comparing companies as a whole.</p>
						<p><strong>The AMD lineup</strong> (grouped by family):</p>
						<ul class="ul-class">
							<li><strong>Athlon</strong>: AMD currently (2020) uses the Athlon brand for its cheapest APUs. Weak, but fine for budget builds.</li>
							<li><b>Ryzen 3</b>: 4 core CPUs meant for budget builds. Good for everyday usage.</li>
							<li><strong>Ryzen 5</strong>: 4 - 6 cores, aimed at mid-tier builds. Balanced, and a typical choice for AMD gaming systems.</li>
							<li><strong>Ryzen 7</strong>: 8 core CPUs, for mid-to-high builds, where more power is needed. As more modern games begin to&nbsp;take advantage of 8 core systems, those with bigger budgets typically pick CPUs from this range for high-end gaming rigs.</li>
							<li><strong>Ryzen 9</strong>: 12 - 16 cores. For those who need serious computing power. Great for those who play games and get serious work done on the same machine. Pricey!</li>
							<li><b>Threadripper</b>: 24 - 64 core, professional-grade CPU options. Extremely expensive, and not suitable for "only-gaming" PCs.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>The Intel lineup</strong> (grouped by family):</p>
						<ul class="ul-class">
							<li><b>Celeron</b>: The cheapest possible CPUs from Intel. Quite weak, but suitable for everyday usage.</li>
							<li><b>Pentium</b>: Better performance, relatively cheap, but with a weak integrated GPU.</li>
							<li>Core&nbsp;<b>i3</b>: 2 - 4 cores,&nbsp;good for low-tier and mid-tier gaming.</li>
							<li>Core&nbsp;<b>i5</b>: 4 - 6 cores. A&nbsp;balanced choice&nbsp;for Intel gaming builds, but with a price increase.</li>
							<li>Core&nbsp;<b>i7</b>: 4 - 8 cores. As game developers have begun to take advantage of higher core counts, i7 CPUs have become common choices for high-end gaming builds. But the performance increase comes with a price premium.</li>
							<li>Core&nbsp;<b>i9</b>: 8-10 core CPUs, typically Intel's best performers.</li>
							<li><strong>Xeon</strong>: Meant for servers, and thus come without an integrated GPU, and typically cannot overclock. Suitable for those who need the extra threads at a lower price, and do not mind sacrificing the iGPU and the ability to overclock. Extremely expensive, and not suitable for "only-gaming" PCs.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>So what is the best CPU?</strong></p>
						<p>Going by price brackets:</p>
						<ul class="ul-class">
							<li>A person buying the cheapest possible PC should look into the cheapest CPU with an integrated GPU, with a matching mobo. Athlons, Celerons, and Pentiums suit this range.</li>
							<li>If you are on a tight budget (less than $500 total PC cost), a Ryzen 3 or Core i3 should be good.</li>
							<li>If you are on a moderate budget (~$500-$1000 total PC cost), we recommend a Core i5 or Ryzen 5 CPU.</li>
							<li>With a higher budget (~$1000-$1500 total PC cost), Ryzen 7 or Core i7 CPUs are currently the best options.</li>
							<li>Builders with budgets above $1500 for their whole PC should consider Core i9 or Ryzen 9 CPUs.</li>
							<li>Only look into the server-grade and high-end workstation CPUs if you have the intense CPU-heavy workflow that can take advantage of them.</li>

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>What is Overclocking?</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>‘Overclocking’ refers to increasing the clock speed of a CPU above the manufacturer’s settings. For example, Intel’s Core i5-6600K ships with a clock speed of 3.5 GHz, but can easily be overclocked to 4.0 GHz or higher.</p>
						<p>This will give you extra performance similar to the increase in clock speed. For example, going from 3.5 GHz to 4.0 GHz would give you as much as a 15% increase in performance.</p>
						<p>This increase in performance comes at the expense of increased power use and heat output. All CPUs are capable of a different amount of overclocking, and if you go too far, the CPU will become unstable. Symptoms of instability are crashes, restarts, blue screens, and corrupted data.</p>
						<p>Stock heatsinks that ship with your CPU are adequate for running at stock speeds, but may not keep an overclocked CPU cool enough. You also need to make sure your motherboard is capable of overclocking. In short: Do your research!</p>

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>Buy a CPU with more cores?</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The majority of programs (games included) are lightly threaded, which means they only need a few cores to run. Games released as late as 2013 could easily run on just one core. For a long time, having more than a few (2-4) cores brought no benefits to the overwhelming majority of games.</p>
						<p>But the times are changing, and more and more modern games are beginning to take advantage of the extra cores and threads of modern CPUs. As of early 2020, the best CPUs for modern gaming are 8-core CPUs! In the future, if the core count for "best gaming CPU" changes, it will go up, not down.</p>
						<p>There is still a lot of truth to the old wisdom though; in particular, single-core and single-threaded performance are still the best determinants of a CPU’s performance in almost every game.</p>
						<p>Non-gaming programs that may benefit from higher core counts include file compression, video encoding, 3D rendering, and server applications. If you are going to be using your computer for any of those sorts of tasks, then you may benefit from a more expensive CPU. Otherwise stick with a mid-range CPU, unless money is not a concern.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A heatsink and fan (HSF), also known as a CPU Cooler, sits atop the CPU to draw heat away from the CPU and disperse it, because CPUs produce heat while operating. Most CPUs will come with a free “stock” HSF, but if you buy a CPU that comes without a cooler and/or if you plan to overclock your CPU, you will need to buy an “aftermarket” HSF.</p>

            <p>Many people think the stock HSFs are bad. They are actually adequate for stock settings, will work fine, and are free. If you overclock significantly, however, stock HSFs become quite loud. And if you live in a hot area without air conditioning, you may need something better than the stock HSF.</p>

Intel sockets 1150, 1151, 1155, and 1156 all use the same HSF mounting system, so they share compatibility.</li>

						<p>The quality of a motherboard’s power features is a large part of what set an expensive motherboard apart from a cheap one.

						<p><b>DDR4 RAM</b>&nbsp;is the latest available standard. DDR4 speeds are 2133MHz, 2400MHz, 2666MHz, 2800MHz, 2933MHz, and 3200MHz. Some RAM kits are rated as even faster, but support for non-official speeds depends on your motherboard. As of now, DDR4 is supported by all of the current-generation AMD and Intel CPUs. Make absolutely sure to buy RAM that is compatible with your motherboard/CPU.</p>
						<p>When you’re shopping for RAM, get the fastest speed that you can, as long as the price difference is reasonable. Each small increase in RAM&nbsp;speed&nbsp;makes a similar (small) increase in performance. It adds up, with 3200MHz -&nbsp;3600MHz usually being the "sweet spot" for performance vs price, so that might be worth it if your budget is flexible. For a lot of everyday tasks, RAM speed will not make that big a difference.</p>
						<p>The one exception to this is APUs, such as AMD's G-series APUs, which combine the CPU and GPU into one chip. Having more bandwidth and lower latency becomes useful in that case, because the built-in GPU uses your main memory. If you can find faster RAM for a small price increase, it is worth getting if you are using an APU.</p>

								<p>This is the most common type of SSD. These will work in any modern desktop, and most laptops. SATA III (3) is the most recent version, and allows speeds up to about 600 MB/s. SATA versions are backwards compatible, meaning you don’t have to worry too much about which version of SATA your motherboard or SSD are, because everything will operate at the fastest speed that both allow. These SSDs tend to offer the best combination of speed, capacity, and price.</p>

								<p>M.2 is a new form factor for SSDs. They come in a variety of sizes and interfaces, which makes them a bit tricky. The most common size is M.2 2280, such as the Samsung 950 Pro above.</p>
								<p>M.2 SSDs are available with the same SATA interface as the 2.5” SATA SSDs discussed above. These will have the nice small M.2 size, but will be limited to the 600 MB/s speed of SATA. The newer and faster type is M.2 PCIe (PCI-Express). The PCIe drives can transfer data at up to 3900 MB/s. An M.2 PCIe SSD is the fastest reasonable storage option for most people, but you will have to make sure your motherboard has an M.2 PCIe slot.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Another option with PCIe SSDs is AHCI or NVMe. This refers to a layer of the data interface. The summary is that NVMe was designed with SSDs in mind, so it is a little better as long as your motherboard and operating system support it. Any motherboard from about 2015 on, and Windows 8 or greater support NVMe.</p>

						<p>An alternative way of using an SSD is to use it as a cache for your regular hard drive. This simplifies use, because in Windows you just see a single drive, so you don't have to worry about where to install programs or store data. The best way to do SSD caching is to use Intel's Rapid Response Technology, available on high-end chipsets since Z68. To use, install Windows like normal on your regular HDD, then connect your SSD, change a few settings in the BIOS, then install and configure Intel's drivers.&nbsp;</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
						<p>A hard disk drive (HDD) is one of two options for storing your data, along with solid state drives (SSD). Both options can be used to install your operating system and applications, as well as any files—such as videos, audio, and documents. HDDs are slower than SSDs, but you get larger amounts of storage for your money.</p>

						<p>If you plan to use an HDD for your operating system and important applications, you definitely want a 7200RPM drive. A Western Digital Black or new Blue, or new Seagate Barracuda have very similar performance, so get whichever is cheapest. For a bit of extra reliability, go with a 7200 RPM HGST drive.</p>
						<p>For general data storage, any reputable drive is fine. You don't need the speed of a 7200 RPM drive. If using an SSD for your Operating System and not editing large amounts of video or audio, get whatever is cheapest. Again, if you want extra reliability, go with an HGST drive. Or, for real reliability, look into getting additional drives and using RAID for redundancy.</p>

						<p>HDDs contain a number of platters, each holding data. Try to get the highest platter density possible, or the smallest number of platters. This generally reduces the risks of mechanical failure because of fewer moving parts, and increases performance because more bits can be read at the same rotational speed.</p>

						<ul class="ul-class">
							<li>A RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) is a cheap way to improve HDD read/writes or set up a backup. You will need more than one HDD, and RAID comes with tradeoffs.</li>
							<li><b>Raid-0</b>&nbsp;combines two hard drives as a single drive (2 x 1TB drives seen as a single 2TB drive) and increases sequential read and write speeds. However, it doubles your risk of failure, since either drive failing results in you losing all your data. Since the performance increase is rarely felt outside of specific data intensive tasks (games, browsing, and bootup speeds are hardly affected), we do not recommend RAID-0 for most people.</li>
							<li><b>Raid-1</b>&nbsp;duplicates your data across two drives. Read speeds are faster, but write speed is unaffected. You lose half your space, but if one of the drives fails, you still have all your data and can use the computer like normal. It's still not quite as reliable as backing up your data externally, but once it's set up, your data is duplicated instantly and without you having to do anything. This is a good option for someone with important data, although not a replacement for external backups.</li>

						<p><img alt="Main Graphics Cards Brands" src="assets/graphics-cards_brands.png" width="800"></p>

          <div class="text-component">
						<p>A single powerful card is usually enough to play most games on a 1080p screen at 60 frames per second (FPS), but some gamers want to play games at higher resolutions (1440p or 4K) and/or higher framerates (144-240FPS). Many PC enthusiasts build computers containing <strong>more than one graphics card in order to gain additional graphical performance</strong> that allows gaming at higher resolutions/framerates. The technology that links graphics cards together is called SLI with NVIDIA and CrossFire with AMD.</p>
						<p>The amount of additional performance gained from additional GPUs will vary depending on the game, but it will always be less than 100% increase. Having two GPUs will generally get you between <strong>60-80 percent performance improvement</strong> over one GPU. A third GPU will often add at least another 20 percent to your performance compared to two GPUs, which is generally not very efficient. A fourth GPU usually doesn’t help much at all, and in many cases the framerate even decreases when compared to three GPUs.</p>
						<p>Note that multi-GPU setups may have <strong>issues with temperature, noise, power draw, game compatibility, and future upgrades</strong>. The fewer GPUs, the less chance you have of running into these issues. &nbsp;</p>

						<p>Use a PSU calculator (e.g.&nbsp;Outervision's PSU Calculator) to determine your power needs. Your PSU will be more efficient, cooler, quieter, and less stressed when running at lower loads, so a good idea is to get a slightly more powerful PSU than needed. Getting an overpowered PSU will not cost you extra on your power bill, either. If you get a 1000W power supply and your PC only needs 150W, the 1000W PSU will only supply 150W.</p>
